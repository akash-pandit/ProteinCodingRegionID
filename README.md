## Protein Coding Region Identifier

#### Purpose

This project is designed to read in a nucleotide sequence and a protein sequence and determine if that protein can be coded for by that nucleotide sequence. Valid nucleotide sequence types include DNA, pre-mRNA, and mRNA. 

The meta-goals for this project are also to put down everything I've learned in constructing a bioinformatics pipeline to good use, a first 'practice' pipeline to test my own skills on both solving an interesting problem and following convention and common practices while doing so. An incredibly important technical lesson I've learned in my first year of college is that while solving the problem at hand is obviously important, doing so in a standardized manner while adhering to good practices is nearly if not as important.

The skills I've practiced in this project include writing clean, legible, and pythonic code, following an effective file structure for the pipeline, learning BASH scripting through a project, introducing the R language in a project, writing effective unit tests for my code, and effectively documenting my code.
